# WIP: Ã…tervinn Stan

## About
Mobile app encouraging and helping people to recycle their garbage, guiding them to nearby recycling stations in the city. See prototype [here](https://github.com/uddesson/atervinn-stan-prototype).

The app is currently IOS only and available for phone and iPad.

## Requirements

#### App
* node
* react-native-cli
* flow v 0.78.0

_NOTE: react native comes with support for flow but it requires an older version._

#### Server
* express
* cors


## Libraries
### `React-native-maps`
In the prototype we used react-maps which took use of google maps. Since then googles pricing has been changed. A lot of other map libraries also requires an API key from google. In react-native-maps its possible to use apple maps ie its free of charge.
